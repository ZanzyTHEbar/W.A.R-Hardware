# W.A.R

This repo is dedicated to the **DIY** Android based *Augmented Reality Headset*. 

# WHAT IS THIS PROJECT

Running on Android 8.1 with 4 cameras and an iTOF sensor, this headset will leverage ARCore and open source Deep Learning algorithms to provide a custom personal assistant Waifu. 

W.A.R will come pre-installed to all headsets. 

Developer access and an SDK are available upon request.

# HOW TO ORDER PCBS

PCBS can be ordered from JLCPCB or PCBWay, or made yourself. The PCB files are still in prototype phase and i welcome any development ideas. 

Files include: 

1. Bill of Materials - BOM 
2. Gerber files
3. Pick and Place files (though this is really just an I2C breakout HAT for the Orange Pi 4B) 

# HOW TO SETUP

Setup is very straight forward, thankfully. 


__*SETUP*__

1. Acquire PCB and sensors. 
2. Assemble per the schematics included in this repo 
3. Plug the sensors into the Orange Pi HAT - take note that 2 Qwiic connects are 3V while only 1 is 5V
